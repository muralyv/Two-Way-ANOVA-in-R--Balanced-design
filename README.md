# Two-Way-ANOVA-in-R (Balanced design)
Evaluate the effect of two factors (fungal isolation medium and fungal isolates) on fungal growth. 

Rice blast fungus was islated from six different places and each was allowed to grow in four different mediums. The growth was measured after 14 days.

Test hypotheses:
Null hypothesis (H0) :     There is no effects in fungal isolation medium in fungal growth or
                           There is no effects difference in fungal isolates in fungal growth

Alternate Hypothesis (Ha): There is effects in fungal isolation medium in fungal growthor
                           There is effects in fungal isolates in fungal growth


This analysis was done for Dr. Suvanthini Terensan's research in 2020
